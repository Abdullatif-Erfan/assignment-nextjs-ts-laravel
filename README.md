# Assignment app with Next.js, [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) and TypeScript

I have developed a simple web application that displays a list of students (fetch from [online](https://pmisndc.gov.af/erfan_websites/laravel_api/student_list) rest api). 

Topics covered in this Application:

- Show students list.
- Add new student. 
- Delete student record.
- Update student record.

Topics that will be covered in future examples:

- Authentication.
- SSR or SSG.
- Server side pagniation.
- React Query.
- .....


## Getting started 

Create a repository and name it 
    
    assignment_nextjs_ts_laravel

Create a sub repository and name it 
    
    client

Switch to the repo folder

    cd assignment_nextjs_ts_laravel\client

Clone the repository

    git clone git@github.com:Abdullatif-Erfan/assignment-nextjs-ts-laravel.git

Install all the dependencies using yarn or npm, suppose you are using npm run the following commands:

- `npm install`
- `npm run build` — Creates an optimized production build of your application.
- `npm run dev` — Starts the application in development mode at `http://localhost:3000`.
